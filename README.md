# Guzzle Throttle Middleware

This middleware adds throttling capabilities to your [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) client.

This can be useful when some hosts limits your number of requests per second / per minute.

## Installation

> composer require diablomedia/guzzle-throttle-middleware

## Counter storage

By default, request counters are stored in an array.

But you can use the `PSR6Adapter` to store your counters within a [psr/cache](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) implementation,
such as [symfony/cache](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html), and use shared storages like Redis, APCu, Memcached, ...

## Usage

For this middleware to work, you need to register some configurations.

A configuration is composed of:

- A Request matcher (to trigger or not the throttler, depending on the request content)
- A maximum number of requests
- The period, in seconds, during which the maximum number of requests apply.
- A storage key.

You can register as many configurations as you need. The 1st request matcher wins.

## Example

```php
namespace App\RequestMatcher;

use BenTools\Psr7\RequestMatcherInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface;

class ExampleOrgRequestMatcher implements RequestMatcherInterface
{
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function matchRequest(RequestInterface $request)
    {
        return false !== strpos($request->getUri()->getHost(), 'example.org');
    }
}
```

```php
use App\RequestMatcher\ExampleOrgRequestMatcher;
use BenTools\GuzzleHttp\Middleware\Storage\Adapter\ArrayAdapter;
use BenTools\GuzzleHttp\Middleware\ThrottleConfiguration;
use BenTools\GuzzleHttp\Middleware\ThrottleMiddleware;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\HandlerStack;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$stack = HandlerStack::create();
$middleware = new ThrottleMiddleware(new ArrayAdapter());

// Max 1 request per second
$maxRequests = 1;
$durationInSeconds = 1;
$middleware->registerConfiguration(
    new ThrottleConfiguration(new ExampleOrgRequestMatcher(), $maxRequests, $durationInSeconds, 'example')
);

$stack->push($middleware, 'throttle');
$client = new Client([
    'handler' => $stack,
]);

$client->get('http://www.example.org'); // Will be executed immediately
$client->get('http://www.example.org'); // Will be executed in 1 second
```

## Tests

> ./vendor/bin/phpunit

## Known issues

Due to PHP's synchronous behaviour, remember that throttling means calling `sleep()` or `usleep()` functions, which will delay your entire script, and not only the current request.

This means throttling will also block Guzzle's asynchronous requests when using `CurlMultiHandler`.

To prevent this, you may have a look at [bentools/guzzle-queue-handler](https://github.com/bpolaszek/guzzle-queue-handler), a handler that delegates asynchronous requests to PHP workers (Beanstalk, RabbitMQ, Redis, ...).

You can then enable throttling only on workers.
